## 🎨 Design Choices

  Indigo → Blue → Cyan gradient to give a modern, tech-savvy look.

- **Animations**:  
  Entrance and hover animations are subtle, handled via `framer-motion`, to enhance user engagement without distraction.

- **Form Experience**:  
  Inline validation provides real-time feedback without disrupting user flow. After successful submission, a clean confirmation message is shown.

- **OG Image**:  
  Dynamically designed Open Graph image enhances link previews when shared on social platforms.
